# About
This is a patch for [UI Enhancement](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3008116624) that retextures it in the style of [Better Action Bar & Icons (Numbered Bar & Tiered Blueprints Edition)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1236279368).

Tecnically any mod that brings the action bar to the bottom edge of the screen should work, as long as it follows the same layout and has a priority lower than 30.

You also can install [the original Better Action Bar](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=959068300) instead, tough you won't have the colored blueprints, unless you install that mod separately.

You can also not install Better Action Bar at all, but you'll miss on the icons.
